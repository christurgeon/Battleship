-  The  host/server/Player1  must construct the board and send the information
   to the client before the client can try to connect.

-  SERVER == Player 1

   1. SERVER: Run run_game.cmd script and click "Wait for Player to Connect"

   2. SERVER: If no configuration file, you will be prompted to enter board information,
              you can specify the size of the board, the size of the 5 vessel types
              and the number of these 5 vessel types that you want.

   3. SERVER: Click "Game" in the menu bar and configure "Network Settings".
              Enter a port number and a host IP address. To play locally, use the
              default input! [THE PROGRAM HAS DEFAULT localhost, port 25000]

   4. SERVER: Feel free to edit the countdown timer in the "Game" menu.

   5. SERVER: Click "Game" in the Menu Bar and click "Place Ships", you will
              now be allowed to place all of your ships on the top board. You may
              change the orientation to vertical or horizontal by using the
              check box on the bottom.

              a. If you make a mistake, click Place Ships again and you can place
              all of your ships again.

              b. When you are ready to play, click "Done Placing Ships"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ----- PLAYER 2 CANNOT CONNECT UNTIL PLAYER 1 clicks "Done Placing Ships" -----
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   6. CLIENT: Now have the second player run the script and click
              "Connect to Another", this player must specify initial network
              settings and now this player can place all of the ships
              and click "Done Placing Ships" to send the board back to
              the host player and the game will begin.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    After each game, a configuration file is written and it contains all of the
    ships and their relevant sizes and amounts. It also contains the default
    round timer. The color of the board is not persisted between rounds because
    it is extremely easy to change. The network settings also do not save but they
    are easily changed and have localhost default values.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: Network settings, countdown timer settings, and ship placement cannot
      be changed when Player 1 successfully sends over the game and Player 2
      successfully connects to Player 1.

NOTE: The top board is your board and the bottom board is where you try
      to take down your opponents ships.

NOTE: Delete the configuration file (_CONFIG_.txt) if you want to choose
      a custom board size and your own ship sizes and count.

NOTE: Only one game can be played. Both users must exit and restart to play again.
